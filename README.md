# Enable Banking API Code Samples

This repository contains code samples for utilizing the [Enable Banking API](https://api.enablebanking.com/).

## Prerequisites   

To successfully use these samples, please follow these steps:

1. Create a developer account at https://enablebanking.com/ by pressing "Get started".

2. Register a new application at https://enablebanking.com/cp/applications.
   If you opt to generate the private key for the application in the browser, the application's
   private key file will be downloaded to your computer. It will be named with the ID assigned to
   the application and have a ".pem" extension (e.g., `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee.pem`).

4. Modify values of the `keyPath` and `applicationId` fields in the `config.json` file with the
   values obtained in previous step.
   *This step in not necessary if you are going to use our Postman collection.* 

5. Navigate to a folder with code samples in a language of your choice and follow the instructions
   provided in the README.md file, which can be found there.
